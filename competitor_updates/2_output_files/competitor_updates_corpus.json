One of them was a managed reverse proxy, and it just launched.Reverse proxies are helpful because they help stop your events getting intercepted by ad blockers, but they're also usually a bit of a pain to configure. So, we built our own directly into PostHog.Available now as part of the Teams plan, you canenable the reverse proxy via your PostHog settings.You cancheck the docs for more info, but it's remarkably easy to set up. Simply add in any domain you control and the system will spit out a CNAME that you then need to set in your DNS provider. Wait a few seconds for the update and, voila, the reverse proxy is live!",

      "update_span_text": "",
      "update_text": "Today, we\u2019re excited to launch Layers. This release combines the flexibility of Eppo feature flags with the structure to easily coordinate concurrent tests.There are scenarios where you may want to test different variations simultaneously on the same area of your product. However, allowing these experiments to overlap can lead to conflicts and degrade the user experience. Eppo's new Layers functionality solves this by enabling you to create dedicated spaces for running mutually exclusive experiments.A More Structured Approach\u200ePrevious approaches to handling concurrent tests involved complex coordination or creating dependencies between flags. With Layers, you can easily set up a structured environment that keeps your experiments isolated while providing controls over traffic allocation and ordering of experiments.Each Layer acts as a contained space with the following levels:Experiment opt-out rule - set an exclusion group here that always sees the same experience, such as internal users that always see the new experienceExperiments - use this level to serve concurrent experiments with the ability to set the traffic exposure of each experimentRollout - once an experiment concludes, you can easily select the winning variant and roll it out to all unallocated usersDefault serving rule - set the control variation users see when not exposed to an experiment or rolloutThis streamlined workflow minimizes coordination overhead and ensures your experiments don't interfere with each other's results, while giving you the power to exclude users and roll out winning variations as soon as they\u2019re selected.Rigorous Controls, Simplified Process\u200eEppo applies the same powerful statistical engines and guardrails to experiments run in Layers as our core experimentation product. You'll get automated diagnostics, traffic balance monitoring, and our full suite of analysis tools to properly measure impact.Creating a new Layer is simple - just navigate to Configuration, enter details like the Layer name and parameters, and you're ready to start adding experiments. Need to roll out a winning variation? With one click, you can update the Layer's default experience.Utilize Parameters to Create No-code Experiences\u200eParameters are the core building blocks that allow you to define the specific elements you want to test variations of within a Layer.For example, let's say you want to experiment with different messaging headlines on your product's homepage. You could create a Parameter called \"headline_text\" and set a default value. Then, as you set up each experiment variation within that Layer, you can specify alternative text values to test.Parameters can accept various data types like strings, numbers, booleans etc. This flexibility enables you to test everything from UI styling and design elements to pricing variants and feature configurations - all within the same Layer construct.Additionally, this means parameter values can drive experience changes without updating code. This no-code solution makes it easy to increase the number of variations you test and experiments you run to find the optimal solution to your hypothesis.Experimenting TogetherWhether it's a product and marketing team collaborating on a page, or parallel AI experiments, Layers enable your organization to maximize learnings through disciplined, concurrent experimentation.Check out our docs to learn more about how to get started with your first Layer."

      "update_text": "We're excited to announce the launch of Audiences - a powerful new way to define reusable targeting criteria for your feature flags. With Audiences, you can easily build segments of users based on any combination of attributes and rules. Simply create an Audience once, then reuse it across multiple flags instead of recreating the same targeting logic from scratch each time.But Audiences aren't just convenient, they're also built for safety. Audiences are locked once any flags use them, requiring proper permissions to make changes that are clearly communicated and non-destructive. This resilient model minimizes risk and ensures stable, reliable targeting.Audiences give you a robust way to tune your rollout experience.Read the documentationfor more info and give them a try in Configuration."

Note that subjects seen in multiple variants will be filtered out of Eppo analysis.Partition keysIf your table has a partition on a different column other than the event timestamp (i.e. event date), Eppo can use it for filtering queries more efficiently. To specify a partition key, map the column to the Partition Date field.Aged conversion metricsFor conversion metrics, you can now choose to enable filtering out subjects until they are aged. This will only count events once a subject has been assigned to the experiment for the conversion period specified. Using a 7-day conversion metric example, a subject will only be included once they've been assigned to the experiment for 7 days.Restore feature flagsThe audit log now provides restore version functionality. When inspecting a previous version, you can easily see what changes will be made by restoring this version. Click on the `Restore` button to make the change.Restore functionality is only available to users who have edit rights to the Feature Flag."

However, some problems require real-time optimization instead. That\u2019s where Contextual Bandits come in. Eppo\u2019s Contextual Bandits offer an easy way for you to automatically optimize and personalize user experiences in real-time to ensure you\u2019re not leaving money on the table.Example use cases for Contextual BanditsContextual bandits are particularly well suited forlightweight and dynamic recommendation problems.Promotions\u200bSuppose we have a rotating set of seasonal promotions that we can show to users. We can use Eppo's Contextual Bandit to automatically personalize promotions to particular users based on their past behavior. Because promotions are often short-lived, it is important to efficiently learn which users get the most value out of them.Dynamic feature highlighting\u200bProduct-led growth B2B companies use Eppo's Contextual Bandits to automatically personalize the features they show to their users. In this case, past user behavior can indicate which out of an expanding set of pro features are most relevant in encouraging users to upgrade. Or it can personalize landing pages to optimize for lead generation.Recommendations\u200bRecommendations benefit not just from context of what the user searched for, but also who they are. Contextual bandits can augment recommendations by adding additional personalization context. This can dynamically feed into recommendation weights and optimize for click-through.Getting startedEppo Contextual Bandits uses the Eppo SDK. If you immediately want to get started with Contextual Bandits, check out ourGetting Started guide. Or check outall our documentation on how Eppo Contextual Bandits work."
