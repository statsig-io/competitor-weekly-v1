Now, we\u2019re ready to support more users and have moved to an open beta.Our data warehouse enables you to import your business data and analyze it alongside your product data. This is useful if, for example, you want to chart app sign-ups against Stripe revenue, or investigate how retention correlates with account sizes.You can import data from object stores you control or using integrations we have for platforms such asStripe,Hubspot, andPostgres.Our data warehouse will be entirely free to use during the beta period, but we do plan to introduce pricing after it launches into general release. We\u2019ll give anyone on the beta plan a two week warning before pricing rolls out, so they can switch to the free plan if needed.We\u2019re actively building out features to give you better control of the volume of rows synced and stored. Ready to give it a try?Start syncingorcheck out the docs.",

Check outthe PRto see how we did it!F-strings are great for inlining inlining properties if you have a lot of them, making HogQL breakdowns like this possible:f'{properties.$browser} @ {properties.$browser_version}, {properties.$os}This change also introduces an internal capability to parse HogQL snippets inside curly brackets in plain text. We're planning to use this for webhook messages, so we can do 'full HogQL', e.g.:total: {1 + 2}, status: {properties.name = 'Tom' ? 'Great guy' : 'Do not sell'}.",
